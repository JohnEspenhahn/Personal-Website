    I am a Junior Computer Science major at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. While I am only on my third year of my formal education in 
    computer science, I have been programming for eight years now and working as a Full-Stack Software Developer for nearly four years. Recently my platform 
    of choice has been a combination of ASP.NET Webforms, MS SQL, and Angularjs. I have extensive experience with Java and Javascript, and I have worked with PHP, 
    Node.JS, C, and Python in the past.
