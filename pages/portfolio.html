            <p>
                Audit Bench is an online platform to manage the auditing, management, and resale of assets. It was originally developed in the early 2000s
                in original ASP. In the summer of 2016 we began a full-rewrite with the goal of increasing ease-of-use and to introduce some new features 
                users have been requesting for years, but original ASP could not provide. On this project I have been the lead full stack developer working 
                in C# ASP.NET, MS SQL, and AngularJS.

            <p>
                In 2012 Traffic Data Exchange (TDE) began working on a new piece of software to modernize their import process and remove their dependency on old
                deprecated proprietary software. In early 2013 I was hired to continue this process. This part of the software is written in Java using the Spring
                Framework. I finished up the work that was started in 2012, which TDE now uses internally, and began work on a client-facing page. This page would
                allow TDE’s customers to create custom reports instead of having to put in a request for TDE to manually create a report. This is written in PHP
                and Javascript. The backend server is MySQL.
